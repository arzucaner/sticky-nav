# Sticky Nav

---

## This project is part of the 30-Day Vanilla JS Coding Contest created by Wes Bos. The goal of the project is to create a sticky navigation exercise where effects are applied to a scroll-activated web page. The code is written in pure JavaScript without the use of any frameworks or libraries. The result is a sleek and functional navigation that stays fixed at the top of the screen as the user scrolls down the page. With its clean code and visually pleasing design, this project is a great example of the power and versatility of pure JavaScript.
